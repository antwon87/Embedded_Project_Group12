# Embedded_Project_Group12

This is a group project that I did in my Real-time Embedded Systems class as part of my Master's degree. The goal was use a Teensy 3.2 microcontroller board to control a small vehicle. The vehicle had to navigate a maze by locating and moving towards (but not hitting) beacons emitting different frequencies of sound. The order of frequencies to reach the end was known. We used a microphone to detect the sound and an ultrasonic distance sensor to avoid hitting beacons. I also designed and 3D printed a parabolic antenna to focus the sound on the microphone.
